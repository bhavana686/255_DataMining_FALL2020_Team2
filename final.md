# Final Report
## Abstract
United States have a higher rate of police killings with 3 people being killed per day on an average. The factors that impact these killings needs to be analysed and studied to understand different aspects leading to the killings. The killings might be impacted by factors like ethnicity, income levels, education etc and also determine the possibility of being an victim of the killings. The analysis include Preprocessing the data by use of techniques like removing outliers, eliminating noise and filling out missing values in an appropriate manner. Then process the data to find the useful information by visualizing it for clear understanding by using histograms, scatter plots etc. Then Data Mining techniques such as Feature Selection, Decision Tree Classification, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchial and Agglomerative Clustering, Correlation Analysis, Nearest Neighbour Classification, and Pricipal Component Analysis will be applied to further analyse the data.
